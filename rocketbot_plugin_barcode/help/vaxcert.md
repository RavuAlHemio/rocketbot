* `{sopfx}F NAME`/`{lopfx}normalized-first-name NAME`: Given name of the vaccinated person, transliterated according to the rules set forth in ICAO 9303 part 3 section 6A. Automatically transliterated from `{sopfx}f`/`{lopfx}first-name` by default; note that automatic transliteration is currently only supported for names in Latin alphabet.
* `{sopfx}L NAME`/`{lopfx}normalized-last-name NAME`: Transliterated surname of the vaccinated person. Same rules and caveats apply as for `{sopfx}F`/`{lopfx}normalized-first-name`.
