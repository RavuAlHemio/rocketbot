*Usage:* `{cpfx}remember USERNAME SUBSTRING`

Searches the recent channel history for the most recent message from the given user that contains the given substring and adds this message to the quote database.

Note that adding a quote does not change the current quote for the purpose of `{cpfx}upquote`/`{cpfx}uq` and `{cpfx}downquote`/`{cpfx}dq`. You must therefore first search for the given quote before voting on it. This behavior may change in the future.
