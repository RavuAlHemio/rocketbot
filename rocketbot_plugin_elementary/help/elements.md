*Usage:* `{cpfx}elements [{lopfx}lang LANGUAGE] ELEMENTS`

Decodes a sequence of chemical element symbols (such as `H He Li Be`) into element numbers or names.

By default, decodes elements into their atomic number.

Specifying `{sopfx}l LANGUAGE` or `{lopfx}lang LANGUAGE`, where `LANGUAGE` is an ISO 639 alpha-2 language code, outputs element names in that language instead of their atomic numbers.
