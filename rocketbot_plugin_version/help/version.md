*Usage:* `{cpfx}version`

Displays the Git revision from which the current bot codebase has been built.

The revision is integrated into the source code within the CI/CD pipeline. If the bot has been built outside of the regular CI/CD pipeline, the response may be obstinate at best and spurious at worst.
