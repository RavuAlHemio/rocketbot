Returns the most active riders.

When calculating the number of unique vehicles, only the first vehicle in the ride is considered. This ensures that the uniqueness percentage does not go beyond 100% and allows some comparability between rides with coupled vehicles.

Normally considers all rides "since the beginning of time". This can be limited:
* With `{sopfx}y` or `{lopfx}last-year`, only considers rides in the last 366 days.
* With `{sopfx}m` or `{lopfx}last-month`, only considers rides in the last 31 days.
* With `{sopfx}w` or `{lopfx}last-week`, only considers rides in the last 7 days.
* With `{sopfx}d` or `{lopfx}last-day`, only considers rides the last day (24 hours).
