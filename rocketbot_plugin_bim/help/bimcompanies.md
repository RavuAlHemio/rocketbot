*Usage:* `{cpfx}bimcompanies [COUNTRY]` or `{cpfx}bimcompanies ?`

Returns the known public transport operator companies. Their names can be passed to the `{sopfx}c` or `{lopfx}company` option on most other commands in this plugin.

If no country is given, lists all the operators in the country of the default operator. If `?` is given instead of a country, lists the available countries.
