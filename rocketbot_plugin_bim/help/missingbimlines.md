*Usage:* `{cpfx}missingbimlines [REGION]`

Informs which lines in the given region have not yet been ridden.

Since line operation may change hands over time, a line is considered ridden if a ride exists with that line number and a company that matches one of the operators in the region.

A default region chosen by the bot operator is used if none is supplied explicitly.
