*Usage:* `{cpfx}favbims [{sopfx}y|{lopfx}last-year|{sopfx}m|{lopfx}last-month|{sopfx}w|{lopfx}last-week|{sopfx}d|{lopfx}last-day] [USERNAME]`

Outputs each rider's favorite (most-ridden) vehicle. In case of a draw, outputs one of those vehicles at random. If a `USERNAME` is given, outputs the user's top ride counts and the vehicles that match each ride count.

Normally considers all rides "since the beginning of time". This can be limited:
* With `{sopfx}y` or `{lopfx}last-year`, only considers rides in the last 366 days.
* With `{sopfx}m` or `{lopfx}last-month`, only considers rides in the last 31 days.
* With `{sopfx}w` or `{lopfx}last-week`, only considers rides in the last 7 days.
* With `{sopfx}d` or `{lopfx}last-day`, only considers rides the last day (24 hours).
