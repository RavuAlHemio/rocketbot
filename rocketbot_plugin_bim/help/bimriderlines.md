*Usage:* `{cpfx}bimriderlines [-n|--sort-by-number] USERNAME`

Returns the lines ridden by the rider with the given `USERNAME`.

A rider's lines are sorted alphabetically by company and line number by default. Passing `-n` or `--sort-by-number` sorts them by number of rides in descending order instead.
