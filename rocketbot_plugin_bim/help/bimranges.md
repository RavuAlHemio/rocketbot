*Usage:* `{cpfx}bimranges [-p|--precise] [-c|--company COMPANY]`

Returns the number ranges used for all vehicle types.

`-p` or `--precise` attempts to collect the actual vehicle number ranges, not just the minimum and maximum.

`-c` or `--company` specifies the company operating that vehicle. A default company chosen by the bot operator is used if none is supplied explicitly.
