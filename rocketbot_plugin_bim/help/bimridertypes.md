*Usage:* `{cpfx}bimridertypes [-n|--sort-by-number] USERNAME`

Returns the types of vehicles ridden by the rider with the given `USERNAME`.

A rider's vehicle types are sorted alphabetically by company and type by default. Passing `-n` or `--sort-by-number` sorts them by number of rides in descending order instead.
